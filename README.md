# DotNetCoreAngularApp
Dot NET Core 2.X  with Angular 6 Application for learning purposes.

A very basic ASP.NET Core 2.X App with Angular for learning purposes.
The idea is to play with a basic App and make it grow or try out new things.

# WebApiUnsecure
There are 2 projects in this solution. It might not be the best idea or missleading but as it is for learning purposes  I want to compare on the one hand, a single back-end(WebApiUnsecure) project and on the other hand, a backend with a front-end in Angular (DotNetCoreAngularApp)


So these 2 projects can be thought and also run independently.
