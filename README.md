![.NET Core & Angular 6](https://github.com/sebainones/DotNetCoreAngularApp/workflows/.NET%20Core%20&%20Angular%206/badge.svg)

# Introduction

There are **2 projects** in this solution. It might not be the best idea or it may be missleading but as it is for learning purposes I want to compare on the one hand, a single back-end(WebApiUnsecure) project and on the other hand, a backend with a front-end in Angular (DotNetCoreAngularApp)
So these 2 projects can be thought and also run independently.

# DotNetCoreAngularApp
Dot NET Core 2.X  with Angular 6 Application for learning purposes.

A very basic ASP.NET Core 2.X App with Angular for learning purposes.
The idea is to play with a basic App and make it grow or try out new things.

# WebApiUnsecure
This is a very basic REST API back-end and using only HTTP ... for the moment.
